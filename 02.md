### **Option 2: Building with Jupyter Notebooks and Hugging Face Libraries** 📓🤗
- Alternatively, participants can utilize the Jupyter notebook environment on Intel Tiber Cloud to build their own applications from scratch.
- They can leverage standard Hugging Face libraries, such as Transformers, to access pre-trained models for text generation, image generation, and multimodal tasks.
- This approach offers more flexibility and customization options, allowing participants to fine-tune models, experiment with different architectures, and have greater control over the generation process.
- **Check out the Gen AI example on Intel Tiber AI cloud for inspiration**

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach** 🧩
- Participants can also opt for a hybrid approach, using a combination of the provided APIs and custom code in Jupyter notebooks.
- For example, they might use the Phi3 API for story outline generation and then build their own image generation pipeline using Hugging Face libraries in a Jupyter notebook.

Ultimately, the choice between using the provided APIs or building from scratch depends on the participant's technical expertise, time constraints, and desired level of customization. The challenge organizers have provided both options to cater to a wide range of skill levels and preferences.

# 🛠️ **Get Started with Sample Code for AI Marketing Maestro**

### **Step 1: Generate Marketing Copy (Phi3 API)** 📝
Here's how to generate compelling marketing copy tailored to your brand:
```python
import requests

PHI3_URL = "https://cu-vertical-dimensional-continuity.trycloudflare.com/phi3/generate"
PHI3_TOKEN = "TOKEN_PROVIDED" # Replace with the token provided in the API documentation.

def generate_marketing_copy(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {PHI3_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "inputs": f"<|system|>\nYou are a marketing strategist crafting engaging copy.<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>",
        "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 200}
    }
    response = requests.post(PHI3_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("generated_text", "")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
        return ""

# Example usage
prompt = "Create a social media post promoting a new sustainable clothing line targeting eco-conscious millennials."
marketing_copy = generate_marketing_copy(prompt)
print("Generated Marketing Copy:", marketing_copy)
```

### **Step 2: Generate Visuals (Flux API)** 🎨
Create stunning visuals to accompany your marketing copy:
```python
FLUX_URL = "https://maintained-thai-filter-four.trycloudflare.com/imagine/generate"
FLUX_TOKEN = "TOKEN_PROVIDED"  # Replace with the token provided in the API documentation.

def generate_marketing_visual(description, output_file):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {FLUX_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "prompt": description[:200],  # Max 200 characters for the prompt
        "img_size": 512,
        "guidance_scale": 7.5,
        "num_inference_steps": 50
    }
    response = requests.post(FLUX_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print(f"Image saved to {output_file}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example usage
generate_marketing_visual("A vibrant, eco-friendly design showcasing sustainable clothing on a millennial-friendly social media layout.", "marketing_visual.png")
```

### **Step 3: Assemble Platform-Specific Posts** 📜🎨
Combine your marketing copy and visuals into a cohesive, platform-specific social media post:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

def create_social_media_post(image_path, text, output_path):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_path)

    # Create a drawing context
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)

    # Define text properties
    font = ImageFont.load_default()
    text_position = (10, image.height - 50)  # Adjust position based on image size
    text_color = "white"

    # Add text to the image
    draw.text(text_position, text, fill=text_color, font=font)

    # Save the resulting image
    image.save(output_path)
    print(f"Social media post saved to {output_path}")

# Example usage
social_media_copy = "Eco-friendly fashion made for you. 🌍✨ Shop now and make a difference!"
create_social_media_post("marketing_visual.png", social_media_copy, "final_post.png")
```
