### **AI Storyboarding Challenge: Build a Fully Automated Cartoon Strip Generator**

Welcome to the **AI Storyboarding Challenge**, where your creativity meets Generative AI! In this challenge, your task is to **build a fully automated application** capable of generating a dynamic cartoon strip from a **single story prompt** provided by the user. 

The application you build should take the user‚Äôs prompt (e.g., *‚ÄúA detective dog solving mysteries in a comic club‚Äù*) and generate a complete, cohesive cartoon strip, including visuals and accompanying storyline, **entirely through automation**.

---

#### **Challenge Overview**

Participants must design and implement a system that automates the entire workflow of creating a cartoon strip:
1. **Input:** Accept a single, high-level story prompt from the user.
2. **Dynamic Story Generation:** Use text generation models (Phi3 or LLava) to create a multi-scene story outline based on the user's input.
3. **Visual Creation:** Generate unique images for each scene in the story using AI image-generation models (e.g., SDXL or Flux).
4. **Story Expansion:** Refine each scene by feeding the generated images and descriptions into multimodal AI tools to enhance narrative depth and continuity.
5. **Scene-to-Scene Continuation:** Dynamically use the output of one scene to guide the content of the next, ensuring the cartoon strip is cohesive and engaging.
6. **Final Assembly:** Automatically stitch together the images and story descriptions into a polished cartoon strip format (e.g., an image, or web interface).

#### Sample Code to Get Started

**Step 1: Generate a Story Outline (Phi3 API)**
The following snippets will guide you through interacting with the APIs to create your own automated cartoon strip:
```python
import requests

PHI3_URL = "https://cu-vertical-dimensional-continuity.trycloudflare.com/phi3/generate"
PHI3_TOKEN = "your_phi3_token"

def generate_story_outline(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {PHI3_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "inputs": f"<|system|>\nYou are a creative story writer.<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>",
        "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 300}
    }
    response = requests.post(PHI3_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("generated_text", "").split("\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
        return []

# Example usage
prompt = "A brave puppy and robot friend solving mysteries in a futuristic city."
story_outline = generate_story_outline(prompt)
print("Story Outline:", story_outline)
```

**Step 2: Generate an Image (Flux API)**
```python
FLUX_URL = "https://maintained-thai-filter-four.trycloudflare.com/imagine/generate"
FLUX_TOKEN = "provided token" # check the API docs in resources

def generate_image(description, output_file):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {FLUX_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "prompt": description[:200],  # max 200 characters allowed for prompt
        "img_size": 512,
        "guidance_scale": 7.5,
        "num_inference_steps": 50
    }
    response = requests.post(FLUX_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print(f"Image saved to {output_file}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example usage
generate_image("A puppy and a robot in a futuristic cityscape with neon lights.", "scene_1.png")
```

**Step 3: Assemble Images and Descriptions**

- Combine generated images and expanded story descriptions into a comic strip.
- Use tools like Python‚Äôs Pillow library for formatting and adding text to images.
- Output the final result as a slideshow, web page, or PDF.
