## 🚀 **Challenge Overview**

Participants will design and implement a system that automates the *entire process* of creating a manga series. Here's how:

1. **📝 Input:** Take a single, high-level story prompt from the user.
2. **📚 Dynamic Story Generation:** Use text-generation models (e.g., Phi3 or LLava) to create a *multi-chapter story outline* based on the user's input.
3. **🎨 Visual Creation:** Generate unique manga-style images for each scene using AI image-generation models (e.g., SDXL or Flux).
4. **🌟 Story Expansion:** Refine each scene by combining visuals and descriptions with multimodal AI tools to deepen narrative continuity.
5. **🔗 Scene-to-Scene Continuation:** Dynamically use outputs from one scene to influence the next, ensuring the manga series flows seamlessly.
6. **📜 Final Assembly:** Automatically stitch together images and text into a *polished manga format* (e.g., image series, web page, or PDF).

## 🛠️ **Technical Approaches**

Participants have the flexibility to choose between using the provided APIs or building their own applications using the Jupyter notebook environment on Intel Tiber Cloud with standard Hugging Face libraries.

### **Option 1: Using Provided APIs** 🌐
- The challenge provides access to powerful [Generative AI APIs](https://github.com/adventofmultimodalai/resources/blob/main/api.md), including:
  - **Phi3** for text generation
  - **SDXL** and **Flux** for image generation
  - **LLava-Next** for multimodal inputs
    
- Tools provided by our partners:  
  - **Prediction Guard LLM / LVM APIs** - Let us know if you need TOKEN to access the [APIs provided](https://github.com/adventofmultimodalai/resources/blob/main/README.md#prediction-guard-access-a-variety-of-privacy-conserving-llms-validate-outputs) by Prediction Guard.
  - **AgenticFlow AI by Pixel ML to prototype and build your solution** - Here is more information on how to use the [tools](https://github.com/adventofmultimodalai/resources/blob/main/README.md#agenticflow-ai-by-pixel-ml).
    
- Participants can leverage these APIs to generate story outlines, create manga-style visuals, and combine text and images seamlessly.
- The API documentation provides detailed instructions, authentication tokens, and code examples to get started quickly.
> **Note**: You can easily deploy your own dedicated APIs using [TiberAI Community AI Templates](https://tiberaicommunity.github.io/ai-templates) in just 5 minutes with a single command! 🚀 This gives you the advantage of having your own dedicated resources and customizable templates.

Deploying your own APIs is a great way to take your AI manga generation project to the next level! 📈 Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any assistance or credits to get started. We're here to support you every step of the way! 💜
### **Option 2: Building with Jupyter Notebooks and Hugging Face Libraries** 📓🤗
- Alternatively, participants can utilize the Jupyter notebook environment on Intel Tiber Cloud to build their own applications from scratch.
- They can leverage standard Hugging Face libraries, such as Transformers, to access pre-trained models for text generation, image generation, and multimodal tasks.
- This approach offers more flexibility and customization options, allowing participants to fine-tune models, experiment with different architectures, and have greater control over the generation process.
- **Check out the Gen AI example on Intel Tiber AI cloud for inspiration**

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach** 🧩
- Participants can also opt for a hybrid approach, using a combination of the provided APIs and custom code in Jupyter notebooks.
- For example, they might use the Phi3 API for story outline generation and then build their own image generation pipeline using Hugging Face libraries in a Jupyter notebook.

Ultimately, the choice between using the provided APIs or building from scratch depends on the participant's technical expertise, time constraints, and desired level of customization. The challenge organizers have provided both options to cater to a wide range of skill levels and preferences.

Regardless of the approach chosen, participants should focus on creating an engaging and cohesive manga series, leveraging the power of Generative AI to automate the process from story generation to visual creation and final assembly.

## 🛠️ **Get Started with Sample Code**

### **Step 1: Generate a Story Outline (Phi3 API)** 📝
Here's a high-level overview to generate a *compelling storyline* for your manga series:
```python
import requests

PHI3_URL = "https://cu-vertical-dimensional-continuity.trycloudflare.com/phi3/generate"
PHI3_TOKEN = "TOKEN_PROVIDED" # Use the Token provided in the API docs: https://github.com/adventofmultimodalai/resources/blob/main/api.md#phi3-api-guide

def generate_story_outline(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {PHI3_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "inputs": f"<|system|>\nYou are a creative manga story writer.<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>",
        "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 300}
    }
    response = requests.post(PHI3_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("generated_text", "").split("\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
        return []

# Example usage
prompt = "A doggy detective discovers they have supernatural abilities while navigating a noir-inspired world of secrets, danger, and high-stakes mysteries in a rain-soaked city"
story_outline = generate_story_outline(prompt)
print("Story Outline:", story_outline)
```

### **Step 2: Generate Visuals (Flux API)** 🎨
Bring your manga story to life with *stunning AI-generated images*:
```python
FLUX_URL = "https://maintained-thai-filter-four.trycloudflare.com/imagine/generate"
FLUX_TOKEN = "provided token"  # Check the API docs for details.

def generate_image(description, output_file):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {FLUX_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "prompt": description[:200],  # Max 200 characters for prompt
        "img_size": 512,
        "guidance_scale": 7.5,
        "num_inference_steps": 50
    }
    response = requests.post(FLUX_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print(f"Image saved to {output_file}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example usage
generate_image("A manga-style illustration of a doggy detective who discovers they have supernatural abilities while navigating a noir-inspired world of secrets.", "scene_1.png")
```

### **Step 3: Assemble Images and Text** 🖼️📜
Combine your visuals and story into a *stunning manga series*:
- Use **Python's Pillow library** to format images, add captions, and create a cohesive layout.
- Export your final product as a *slideshow, web page, or PDF*.

> Note: You could use multiple passes to models to generate, validate and ensure consistency
