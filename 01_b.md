## ❄️ Challenge Overview:

### 🎥 Step 1: Create Your Dataset
**Capture the magic of the season!** Instead of relying on pre-made datasets, you’ll build your own unique collection of holiday-themed images.

**🎯 How to Collect:**
- Snap photos of twinkling decorations, cozy holiday treats, or snowy winter scenes. 📸❄️
- Search for cheerful images of Christmas trees, sparkling lights, or festive markets. 🌟🎄
- Combine your personal favorites with online treasures for a dataset full of holiday spirit. ✨

### 🧠 Step 2: Train Your Visual AI Model with Intel Geti
Transform your dataset into something extraordinary! With Intel Geti, create a model that detects and classifies the festive joy you’ve captured.

**🛠️ How to Train:** 
- Upload your dataset to Intel Geti, label your images, and train a model for object detection, classification, or segmentation. 

**🎄 Example Use Cases:**
- Count and label Christmas ornaments glistening on a tree. 🎄✨
- Identify and sort beautifully wrapped gifts by patterns or colors. 🎁🎀
- Detect whimsical winter objects like snowmen, sleighs, or reindeer. ⛄🛷

### ⚡ Step 3: Use the Geti SDK for Model Inference
Bring your trained model to life with the Intel Geti SDK! Use it to generate dazzling processed images or videos, complete with detailed detections and labels. Watch your AI transform holiday scenes into data-driven art! 🎥🌟

---

### 🤖 Step 4: Generate Insights with an LLM
Take your project to the next level by combining visual AI outputs with the analytical power of an LLM. 🎉

**🎨 Example Ideas:**
- *Playful Reports*: “80% of your photos feature gingerbread cookies—yum!” 🍪✨
- *Creative Ideas*: “Sort gifts by size to build a perfect gift pyramid!” 🎁⛰️
- *Trendy Insights*: “Gold wrapping paper is trending in your dataset!” 🌟📊
